# Loss Functions

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file:

- `loss_functions.ipynb` – A complete guide to loss (cost) functions in deep learning, including definitions, formulas, and PyTorch examples.

The notebook covers:
- Regression losses (MSE, MAE,MBE, RMSE, RMSLE, Huber, Log-Cosh Loss)
- Classification losses (Binary Cross-Entropy, Cross-Entropy, )

It is organized for easy reference and experimentation with PyTorch.
